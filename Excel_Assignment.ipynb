        "  1. Explain the difference between Relative, Absolute and Mixed Cell Referencing.\n",
        "\n",
        " - These three types of cell referencing are fundamental to working with formulas in spreadsheets (like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets) as they determine how cell addresses are adjusted when a formula is copied to other cells.\n",
        "\n",
        " Relative Cell Referencing (e.g., A1):\n",
        " Behavior: The cell address changes relatively when the formula is copied to another cell. If you copy a formula one column right and one row down, the cell reference will also shift one column right and one row down.\n",
        "\n",
        " Use Case: Ideal for performing an operation across a whole range of data, like  multiplying corresponding cells in two columns.\n",
        "\n",
        " Absolute Cell Referencing (e.g., $A$1):\n",
        " Behavior: The cell address remains fixed (or \"absolute\") no matter where the formula is copied. The dollar sign ($) locks both the column and the row.\n",
        "\n",
        " Use Case: Essential when a formula needs to consistently refer back to a single, specific cell (e.g., a fixed tax rate or a conversion factor) even when copied down or across multiple rows/columns.\n",
        "\n",
        " Mixed Cell Referencing (e.g., $A1 or A$1):\n",
        " Behavior: One part of the cell address is absolute (locked with a $), and the other part is relative (unlocked).\n",
        "\n",
        " $A1 locks the column (A), but the row (1) will change.\n",
        "\n",
        " A$1 locks the row (1), but the column (A) will change.\n",
        "\n",
        " Use Case: Useful for creating things like multiplication tables or when you need to copy a formula across a range but only want to lock the reference to a specific row header or column header.\n",
